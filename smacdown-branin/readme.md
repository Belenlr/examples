# SMACdown example: optimizing the Branin function

This is a simple SMACdown use case in which we find an extreme of the
[Branin function](http://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/branin.html) using a
generator of random parameterizations of the functions and a SMACdown
evaluator that is simply the value returned by the function itself.

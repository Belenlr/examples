# Feature generation

These two WhizzML packages will let the user extend a dataset with new
auto-generated features. These features are the result of applying
unsupervised models to the dataset.

# Steps

## 1. Generating unsupervised models
Firstly, you have to generate all the unsupervised models.
For this, check the first package: [Unsupervised models
generation](./unsupervised-models)

## 2. Extending the dataset
Then, you will have to execute the second script, passing to it a
reference of the execution you did in the step 1. It will generate the
extended dataset.

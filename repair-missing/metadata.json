  "description": "Use dataset information to fill in missing values for numeric or categorical fields which have at least one value missing.  For numeric fields, we learn a random forest to predict a probable field value given the information that is present.  For categorical fields we add an explict 'missing' category to the field.  In both cases, we also add a binary column indicating whether the value was missing in the original dataset or not.",

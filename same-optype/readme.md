# Same Field Optypes

Sometimes it is difficult to autodetect appropriate optypes for the
fields of sparse or heavily repeating datasets. This script takes a
dataset with the desired optypes and, from a source with the same
field names, creates a dataset with the same optypes. It also matches
the locale and term_analysis of the desired dataset.

# Inputs

- A dataset with appropriately set optypes.

- A source to make a new dataset from.

# Outputs

- A dataset built from that source with appropriately set optypes.
